This new bootsector is basically like the V6 but this time we have an empty BPB.

I thought that it was weird to have to make a "fake BPB" for my BootSector to work on real devices.
We had to make one because the bios behaves weidly if there isn't, but at the same time the BIOS doesn't require it.
Furthermore, i was putting fake values inside of the BPB that didn't reflect the drive's geometry.
My fake BPB was making my BIOS recognise a bad UEFI entry, while my OS has no UEFI support at all.
I got kinda afraid that the fake values i was putting in my BPB would cause problems later, but i found out that the BIOS didn't read these values anyway.
Basically i looked up how much space was allocated for a DOS 4.0 BPB and i filled this space in my BootSector with zeros. It works...
I think that the BIOS just requires the BPB for compatibility reasons, but doesn't use it.
I've done a lot on research on on should i leave it empty or not, and why, and people have very different answers.
