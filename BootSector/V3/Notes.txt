This version prints "Hello" to the user.
I have made a mod version aswell, it's the same but with a blue background (Not because i thought that it would look good, im just tryin)

The blue version is not recommanded because for some reason on the emulator it works fine,
	 but on my laptop the colors doesn't show and "Hello" becomes "Hell"
