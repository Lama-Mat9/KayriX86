This version implements a Bios Parameter Block (BPB) !
The BPB is basically what i was searching for all along. It describes how the physical disk is setup.
Omitting the BPB was the reason why my Boot Sector was stable on emulators but not on real hardware.
Apparently, it is meaningless if we're not using a floppy disk, but my BIOS seems to require it to boot.
Otherwise, it would usually do random things like writing half of my string or one of two strings or even read all memory.
The latest BPBs seem to be from the DOS era, i've used one from DOS 4.0 for a 1.44MB floppy.
What's weird is that windows 10 now recognises my USB as a drive with a capacity of both 14.32 Go and 1 Mo.
I think that windows reads the BPB to get the volume size that i wrote in it, but still knows somehow that this is a 16Go usb drive.
I hope that the floppy drive BPB (1.44mb) won't later prevent me from using the rest of the drive's space, as a 1Mo OS is hmmmm

This means that the Boot Sector is finally usable on real hardware. That's the only modification that V6 has, and that's already a lot.
