This version adds newlines and carriage returns at the same time.
It also adds a function (read_dsk) that can read from disks.

I like how the project is going, we are moving extremely slowly from a high level POV, but too fast in reality.
The functions that i wrote are commented very extensively, and i've put a lot of efforts into making them
as understandable, robust and clean as possible.
Unfortunately, my functions are quite small if we remove all of the comments that i've put. 
This is because i'm using a lot of BIOS routines to do the work for us. 
I know that i am going to have to replace their code with mine later on, and i am only beginning to visualize
how hard it will be to replace them.
In any way, i have learned a LOT of things while working on this project, and i want to continue that way.
In the end, it doesn't matter if the OS uses my or the BIOS's code. I just wanna learn stuff.
