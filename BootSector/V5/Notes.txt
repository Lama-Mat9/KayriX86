WARNING: I do not recommand running this version on real hardware.
Basically i'm still investigating why stuff tends to run weirdly on real hardware but not on emulators.
One of the reasons could be that the bios's tty is just not meant to be used for that. 
It's a minimal implementation anyways and i shouldn't be using it. 

This version makes print.asm available to all programs and simplifies the code. 
It also respects the FASTCALL calling convention (as far as i know ofc. i've tried to make it that way lol)
