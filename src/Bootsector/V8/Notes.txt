In this new version i've added a way to print hexadecimal and therefore have renamed print to prints.
This way we will now be able to print memory addresses easily for debugging purposes.

CRLF was also replaced by a 0x00 byte at the end of each string because 0x00 can be read from both ways.
This is useful because i had some problems when trying to use the stack instead of hardcoding values in
	the code like i was doing before.
